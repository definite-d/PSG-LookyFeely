What's LookyFeely?

LookyFeely is a utility created by definite_d (me) to make the creation of
custom PySimpleGUI Look and Feel theme code a breeze, to be a Christmas gift to
PySimpleGUI users (:santa:), and to act as a bigger 'Thank You' to @MikeTheWatchGuy 
for PySimpleGUI ('bigger' because I've already said 'Thank You' before).

Now you ~~(newbies)~~ don't have to potentially flunk multiline dicts, mess around
with manually typing color codes or set up a vicious cycle from IDE to color picker
(although a professional colour picker may help in choosing colours that go well
with each other). Simply pick your colours, generate your code and have the options 
of previewing the generated stuff instantly, or copy and paste the generated code 
for use. If you like the theme LookyFeely puts on at the moment, you could even use
_that_. Every theme it sports comes with PySimpleGUI. Then again, I've got some
themes generated while testing and playing with LookyFeely. They're in the 
'sample themes' folder.

Version 2:
With the advent of v2, you can havew a theme within the time it takes to have a
theme name typed, 2 mouse clicks and some copy-pasting. You've also got some sweet
options; from auto-generated Dark and Light modes, to updating PySimpleGUI straight
from LookyFeely, to opening this very page in your browser. And yeah, Random's no
longer the only option to pick when you don't specify a color.

If it appeals to you more, you could get away with specifying only two colors and 
auto generating the rest.

Well, it's a shameless (but swanky) code generator :).
It depends on the PySimpleGUI Tkinter version; what I like to call PSG Vanilla.
As for PEP8, I'll leave that to PyCharm to handle. Hopefully I'll adhere that way.

Development began on 29/11/2019, bare minimum (v1.2) got completed on 1/12/2019
Version 2 got uploaded and completed on the Christmas of 2019.
