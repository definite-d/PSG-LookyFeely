###What's LookyFeely?

LookyFeely is a utility created by definite_d (me) to make the creation of
custom PySimpleGUI Look and Feel theme code a breeze while allowing for express 
customization.
 
It was also built to be a Christmas gift to
PySimpleGUI users, and to act as a bigger 'Thank You' to @MikeTheWatchGuy for
PySimpleGUI ('bigger' because I've already said 'Thank You' before). The link to
PySimpleGUI's GitHub repo is up there in the header section.

Now don't have to potentially flunk multiline dicts, memorise color codes (like #FFFFFF), mess around
with manually typing color codes or set up a vicious cycle from IDE to color picker
(although a professional colour picker has its advantages).
 
You can choose to meticulously pick your colours, or get a usable theme with fewer 
clicks than the fingers on one hand instead **(if you don't specify a color though, 
you'll have the options to randomly fill in those colors, fill in with shades of the 
colors actually specified, or get colors from an image)** then generate your code and 
have the options of previewing the generated stuff instantly, or copy and paste the 
generated code for use.

That's not all of its features though. I suggest you check it out yourself.

Don't forget to check out the Sample Themes generated with it as well! You might find the theme
you need in there.

All themes generated with LookyFeely are free to be used as you choose. That applies to
the Sample Themes too.

###Summary, Other Details...

Well, in summary, it's a shameless, swanky theme code generator :smiley:.
It depends on the PySimpleGUI Tkinter version; what I like to call PSG Vanilla.
As for PEP8, I'll leave that to PyCharm to handle. Hopefully I'll adhere that way.

LookyFeely uses PySimpleGUI for its GUI as well. Every theme it sports is a dark
theme that comes with PySimpleGUI by default.

Development began on 29/11/2019, bare minimum (v1.2) got completed on 1/12/2019.
