# PSG-LookyFeely
PySimpleGUI LookAndFeel theme code generator.
  Welcome...
... to LookyFeely.

___________________________________________________________________________________
LookyFeely is a utility created by definite_d (me) to make the creation of
custom PySimpleGUI Look and Feel theme code a breeze, to be a Christmas gift to
PySimpleGUI users, and to act as a bigger 'Thank You' to MikeTheWatchGuy for
PySimpleGUI ('bigger' because I've already said 'Thank You' before).

Now you ~~(newbies)~~ don't have to potentially flunk multiline dicts, mess around
with manually typing color codes or set up a vicious cycle from IDE to color picker
(although a professional colour picker may help in choosing colours that go well
with each other). Simply pick your colours, (or copy the one LookyFeely uses),
generate your code and have the options of previewing the generated stuff instantly,
or copy and paste the generated code for use.

Well, it's a shameless code generator :).
It depends on the PySimpleGUI Tkinter version; what I like to call PSG Vanilla.
As for PEP8, I'll leave that to PyCharm to handle. Hopefully I'll adhere that way.

Development began on 29/11/2019, bare minimum (v1.2) got completed on 1/12/2019.
===================================================================================

LookyFeely uses PySimpleGUI for its GUI as well.
In this repo, there's two compiled versions created with PyInstaller. One is a
"onedir"/folder version while the other is a "onefile" executable. Not sure if
a proprietary PySimpleGUI app compiled with PyInstaller would abide by PySimpleGUI's
modified LGPL v3 without altering the build process (I can't see PSG as a .dll),
but that doesn't matter in this case, right?
